TASK 1: Creating calculator using html,style.css,script.js


Introduction:

A calculator is a basic application that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction,multiplication, and division. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple, interactive calculator with a user-friendly interface. 

It is ideal for beginners to learn how to connect a web page structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript).


Description:

The calculator consists of:

Display Screen: Shows the numbers entered and the result of calculations.

Buttons: Digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, −, ×, ÷), and special buttons like C (Clear), DEL (Delete Last), and = (Equals).

The JavaScript code handles the logic by:

Appending values to the display when buttons are clicked.

Clearing or deleting characters.

Evaluating mathematical expressions using the eval() function.


Tools & Technologies Used:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Provides the structure of the calculator (buttons, display screen).


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Adds styling to make the calculator visually appealing (colors, layout, responsive grid).


JavaScript:

Adds interactive functionality (handling button clicks and calculations).


Code Editor:

Example: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++.


Web Browser:

Any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) to run and test the calculator.


How to use:

Setup the Files:

Create 3 files in the same folder:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Paste the respective code into each file.


Linking Files:

The style.css and script.js are already linked inside index.html.


Run the Calculator:

Open index.html in any web browser.

Using the Calculator:

Click on the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers.

Use the operators (+, −, ×, ÷) for calculations.

Press = to see the result.

Press C to clear all input.

Press DEL to remove the last character.
